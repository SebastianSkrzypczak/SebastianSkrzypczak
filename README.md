I'm an ambitious, willing-to-learn engineer who wants to broaden my skills in both mechanical engineering and IT. I'm focused on designing "as simple as possible," well-working machines, and writing readable and scalable clean code. I'm eager to combine my mechanical engineering expertise with my growing IT skills to contribute to innovative and efficient solutions. Continuous learning and exploring new challenges are essential to me, and I'm excited to embrace opportunities that will further expand my knowledge and abilities.
